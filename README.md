## Key Questions

1. Did increasing avocado prices cause avocado imports to increase and imports of other crops to decrease (Kaggle and USDA)?
2. As prices went up how did domestic and import amount change (USDA)?
3. As avocado prices increase, did imports of affected crops increase from elsewhere?
4. Does the time of year affect the price of avocados?
